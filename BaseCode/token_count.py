Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?
 inference: Initially, the weight is 2 pounds.

After adding brownies, the weight triples: 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

After adding 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight becomes: 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.

After adding gummy worms, the weight doubles: 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.

Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.
