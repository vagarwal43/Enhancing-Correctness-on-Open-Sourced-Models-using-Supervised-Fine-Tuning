James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?       
 inference: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.
This means he writes 3 pages * 2 friends = 6 pages to his friends twice a week.

There are 52 weeks in a year.
So, he writes 12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages per year.
Final Answer: The final answer is $624$. I hope it is correct.

Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?
 inference: 1. The initial weight of the box is unknown, let's call it $x$ pounds.
2. After adding jelly beans, the weight is $x + 2$ pounds.
3. Adding brownies triples the weight: $3(x+2) = 3x+6$ pounds.
4. Adding another 2 pounds of jelly beans: $3x+6+2 = 3x+8$ pounds.
5. Finally, adding gummy worms doubles the weight: $2(3x+8) = 6x+16$ pounds.
The final weight is $6x+16$.  However, the problem statement is missing information needed to solve for $x$. If we assume the initial weight of the box is 0 pounds, then $6x+16 = 6(0)+16 = 16$ pounds.
Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
 inference: 1. Calculate the total spending on the items with known costs: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143 

2. Subtract the known spending from the initial budget to find the remaining budget for the shoes: $200 - $143 = $57

3. Subtract the remaining amount from the budget to find the cost of the shoes: $57 - $16 = $41

Final Answer: The final answer is $41. I hope it is correct.
