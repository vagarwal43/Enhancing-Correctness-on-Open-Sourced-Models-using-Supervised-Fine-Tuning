Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second by 2, we get $12t - 30u = 18$ and $18t - 12u = -6$.  Subtracting the equations, we get $-18u = 24$, so $u = -24/18 = -4/3$.  Then $t = (3+2u)/3 = (3 - 8/3)/3 = (1/3)/3 = 1/9$.  Now $a + 4t = u$, so $a + 4(1/9) = -4/3$, or $a = -4/3 - 4/9 = -12/9 - 4/9 = -16/9$.\nTherefore, the lines intersect if $a = -16/9$.\nThe lines are skew if the lines do not intersect and are not parallel.\nIf $a \\neq -16/9$, then the lines are skew.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{a \\neq -\\frac{16}{9}}$.
